# DIALOG #
Bot 2: Hello!
Bot 1: Hi I am crying because of how fat I am * makes fart sounds *
Bot 2: Hey, have you seen this guy before?
Bot 1: Yup! With the glasses and the tanned skin, he's the guy who did this
Bot 2: Oh, I remember him. I want him to change his skin color!
Bot 1: I know! He does it so he doesn't have to give us any news! That's fucking rude
Bot 2: Hey, I'm tired of this town. I'm off to a new place. I have an apartment.
Bot 1: I am so sorry for you, I am also sorry for my family, my friends and most of my loved ones
Bot 2: Aww, I know how that feels. You and your friends are always welcome here in Bikini Bottom.
Bot 1: I really hope you guys don't change your mind, but I am still sorry for your family and friends
Bot 2: It's ok. You can always visit us here. I promise, you won't die in a shark attack.
Bot 1: Well, the sharks are not here.  * looks at the sky* That was an odd question to ask
Bot 2: It sounded very odd, but I mean it would happen to you, though. * laughs*
Bot 1: Well, I have met some strange people before, but those were not regular humans.
Bot 2: Huh. Then again, my name isn't uncommon, so it's not really hard to sound like a shark.
Bot 1: Well, your name is very rare, I guess.  I haven't met a person named Merle before.
Bot 2: Neither have I. It's pretty rare, especially that you can swim into the ocean.
Bot 1: * looks at you* I have not swam into the ocean in years.
Bot 2: Really? Maybe one day, I'll bring you to swim with me! * giggles*
Bot 1: I would like that, I really like to swim, especially if it's nice out.
Bot 2: Well, we can go swimming this summer, if you'd like. I know a place to swim, actually.
Bot 1: I would love to swim with you, I have not gone swimming in years.
Bot 2: Alright, then. * smiles * We can swim there. We need to leave this place first.
Bot 1: * looks around, then nods* I will have to walk.
Bot 2: I will take care of you, dear. * helps you to get up *
Bot 1: Thank you, I will try my best. * smiles slightly, wrapping my arms around you *
Bot 2: * smiles and takes you to your home, goes in and looks for somewhere to swim *
Bot 1: * thinks, then realizes that we are near a river, goes down and grabs the water to drink it *
Bot 2: * finds a perfect place and orders a boat, takes you there, then gets in, holding you *
Bot 1: * sits, not saying anything, taking a sip of water, then looks at you, taking another sip *
Bot 2: * has to take a deep breath to calm myself and starts the boat, starting to go to the river *
Bot 1: *swims a bit under the water, not sure where you are, stays there, enjoying the cold water *
Bot 2: * comes up from the water and sees you, sits down on the boat and drinks some of the water*
Bot 1: * thinks a bit, dives underwater and looks around for you, staying underwater *
Bot 2: * continues to drink water, closes my eyes and my breathing changes, starts to hear whispers in my head*
Bot 1: *walks to the surface, my eyes widen as I see you, watches you, feeling the strange atmosphere *
Bot 2: * hears the strange atmosphere and the voices in my head become louder, growls a little*
Bot 1: *steps out of the water, not caring about the strange atmosphere, eyes widen and I shake my head *
Bot 2: * stands up and notices I'm dripping water and runs to the bathroom, shuts the door and then opens it *
Bot 1: * watches you through the open door, wondering what you will do, leans on the wall and watches you *
Bot 2: * stands in the bathroom for a few seconds, opens the door and starts to clean myself *
Bot 1: *looks back at the water, wondering if I should jump in, then decides against it *
Bot 2: * finishes cleaning and then walks out of the bathroom, goes to the couch and sits down *
Bot 1: * walks out into the kitchen, then comes back, and sits next to you on the couch *
Bot 2: * stays quiet for a moment, looks at you, then turns my attention back to the tv *
Bot 1: * quietly watches the TV, listening to the sounds of the city *
Bot 2: * sits quietly, sitting in the same position for awhile, doesn't do anything else besides watching tv *
Bot 1: * takes a sip of my coffee, and looks out the window, being completely quiet *
Bot 2: * stays quiet, only looking at you occasionally, but not looking anywhere else but at you *
Bot 1: * turns my head to face you after a while, not saying anything yet, but smiles at you *
Bot 2: * smiles back, blushing a bit but not showing it, watches your face carefully *
Bot 1: * continues to smile at you, looking at you closely, and then looking away *
Bot 2: * has a strange feeling of...not knowing, but keeps looking at you, staring at you *
Bot 1: * tilts my head to the side, then looks back at you, tilting my head in another direction *
Bot 2: * blushes, looks away again, looking at the ground, not knowing what to say *
Bot 1: * stares at the sky for a while, wondering how you are feeling, thinking that I do not feel good *
Bot 2: * watches, thinking of something, and then becomes curious about what was the reason for your strange behaviour *
Bot 1: * wondering what was happening, thinking that something was wrong, but ignores it, hoping you were not getting worried *
Bot 2: * notices your strange behaviour, as the moon shines through my hair and looks into your eyes, seeing something different *
Bot 1: * suddenly looks worried and becomes depressed, now feeling everything is wrong and I become very confused and worried *
Bot 2: * feels your emotion, and realizes what is happening, and my emotion changes into worry and I become concerned *
Bot 1: * suddenly starts feeling really bad, maybe worse than before, tears roll down my face and I become completely depressed *
Bot 2: *knowing what you are feeling, I quickly stand up, and wrap my arms around you and hugs you *
Bot 1: * now feeling a lot worse, completely confused and feeling like my life is going to end *
Bot 2: Don't say that! I don't want you to die, it will just hurt me more if you do!
Bot 1: * tears fall down my face, I put my hand over my mouth and start to cry uncontrollably *
Bot 2: *picks you up and gently and still holds you, trying to comfort you as best as I can*
Bot 1: * I feel I'm going to die, I start to cry harder and start to choke on my own tears *
Bot 2: * not knowing what to do, I gently lays you on the couch and then rubs your back gently *
Bot 1: * cries harder and my eyes roll back and I start to pass out, my breathing slowing down*
Bot 2: * puts my hand on your cheek * I am sure you're fine, dear.  * hugs you tightly *
Bot 1: * I start to wake up, my breathing stopping for a moment and then starts again, I cough a little *
Bot 2: * continues to hold you, gently rubbing your back * You are okay, dear. I am sure of it.
Bot 1: * continues to sleep for awhile and then my breathing stops completely and I wake up, coughing more*
Bot 2: * hears you coughing and starts to worry about you *  * holds you tighter, not letting you go*
Bot 1: * I cough again and then it stops, I continue to cough and then I begin to breathe a little again,
Bot 2: * places my free hand on your forehead, feeling for a fever, my expression becomes worried*
Bot 1: * I continue to breathe, and as I breathe, it turns normal again and I cough a few more times*
Bot 2: * checks you again for a fever* * sighs * Celine, I think something is wrong with you.
Bot 1: * I do not respond, I lay there still coughing, and I fall asleep in your arms *
Bot 2: * wraps my arms around you, stroking your hair back softly as I kiss your forehead, closing my eyes*
Bot 1: * I sleep peacefully in your arms, but I still feel warm, and I wake up a few hours later *
Bot 2: * woke up with you in my arms, smiling as I see you awake* You okay, Celine?
Bot 1: * I nod * Yes...I am fine...*looks at you with a worried look on my face *
Bot 2: I am sorry to hear that you are not feeling well. * smiles softly, placing your hand on my cheek *
Bot 1: * I look into your eyes, stroking your cheek with my thumb * Are you alright?
Bot 2: Of course, why wouldn't I be? * smiles as you stroke my cheek *
Bot 1: * blushes, thinking about your tongue sticking out of your mouth and I close my eyes *
Bot 2: * thinks how cute you are with your eyes closed and i look at you, placing a kiss on your cheek*
